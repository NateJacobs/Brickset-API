# Brickset API #

Version 1.3

Works with WordPress v3.5+

Display your favorite LEGO® set information on your website using the Brickset API. 

## Description ##

This plugin is an implementation of the Brickset Webservice. It includes methods to get LEGO® set and theme data from Brickset as well as pre-formated methods to display set data. The set data requested is cached daily to reduce HTTP requests and page load time. Please visit [Brickset](http://brickset.com/) for more information on the [webservice](http://www.brickset.com/webservices). You can obtain an API key from [Brickset](http://brickset.com/contact/).

The main development is all happening on [GitHub](https://github.com/NateJacobs/Brickset-API).

This is not an official Brickset.com plugin. LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this plugin.

## Oembed ##
You can paste a Brickset set or theme url into your post or page. Once you publish the post or page information about the set or theme will be displayed. Two example URLs are below.

* Set URL: http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=79003-1  
* Theme URL: http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=The%20Hobbit  

## Template Tags ##
The plugin has numerous template tags you are able to use in your theme. They are listed below with a short description.

*	`brickset_themes();` outputs a list of all themes.
*	`brickset_subthemes( $theme );` outputs a table of all subthemes of the theme specified, the number of sets, and years available.
*	`brickset_theme_years( $theme );` outputs a table of all the years the specified theme was available and the number of sets each year.
*	`brickset_popular_searches();` outputs a list of the most popular search terms on Brickset.com.
*	`brickset_updated_since( $date );` outputs a table of the sets updated since the date specified. The table includes thumbnail, set name and set number.
*	`brickset_set_number( $set );` outputs a list of details about the sets specified. More than one set can be requested by separating the set numbers with a comma, e.g. '1380,10240'.

## Shortcode ##
The plugin has a shortcode you may use in your posts and pages to display information about a set or sets.

*	`[bs_set number='XXX']` outputs information about a specific set. Thumbnail, set name, set number, pieces, theme, subtheme and year. You can display multiple sets by seperating the set numbers with a comma.

## Widgets ##
The plugin has two widgets you can activate in your theme. One to display a list of all themes on Brickset with a link to browse each theme on Brickset.com and the second to display the details about a specific set.

## Advanced Use ##
This example shows how to get the data about a specific set. You can find the developer docs [here](https://github.com/NateJacobs/Brickset-API/wiki).

1. Instantiate the class.
```
$brickset = new BricksetAPISearch();
```

2. Pass a set number to the get_by_number method.
```
$set_data = $brickset->get_by_number( '8014' );
```
3. Test for an error
```
if( is_wp_error( $set_data ) {
	echo $set_data->get_error_message;
}
```

4. Display the results how you like. This will display the set's theme.
```
else {
	echo $set_data->theme;
}
```

## Road Map ##
1. Template tags to display sets specific to a user.
2. Allow administrators to set time of cache for set and theme data.
3. Caching of images

You can follow all the open feature requests and enhancements on [GitHub](https://github.com/NateJacobs/Brickset-API/issues?milestone=&page=1&state=open).

## Installation ##

1. Upload the entire `brickset-api` folder to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation or download from the Plugin Repository
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Add your Brickset.com API key to the Brickset settings page which can be found as a submenu under the Settings menu
3. Either add a Brickset link (url) to a set or theme in a post or page, or add a template tag to a theme file, or for advanced use instantiate the class and create your own display method.
